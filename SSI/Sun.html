                <p>At the very centre of the Solar System is the Sun. the Sun is a star, a massive ball of gas which produces huge amounts of heat and light. It is the key reason why the planets in the Solar System are present, and why life on Earth is able to exist. Without the Sun, there would be no light, no warmth, no water, no plants, animals or people.</p>
                <p>The Sun is a star and isn't much different to the millions of other stars in the sky. The reason it appears so much bigger and brighter than other stars is because it is so much closer to Earth than they are, being only eight light minutes away from Earth. This means that it takes eight minutes for the light from the Sun to reach Earth, meaning that when you look at the Sun, you are seeing it as it was eight minutes ago! Although the Sun is the closest star to Earth, it is still a long long way away, being nearly 150 million kilometres away (about 93 million miles). It is also more than ten times wider than Earth which could fit into it over one million times. The fact that it provides so much light and heat to Earth from that distance shows how huge and powerful it is! The nearest star after the Sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.3 Light Years away, or 40,000,000,000,000 kilometres away! (25,000,000,000,000 miles), so, if we were to see that star in the sky, we would be seeing it as it was over four years ago.</p>
                <p>Earth and the other planets in the Solar System spin around the Sun, kept in its orbit by its strong pull of gravity. Each time a planet has spun around the Sun and has returned to where it began, a year has passed. It takes just over 365 days for Earth to spin round the Sun, so a year on Earth is 365 days long. A year on Mercury, the planet closest to The Sun, is only 88 days long, but a year on dwarf planet Pluto, millions of miles away from the Sun, is as long as 248 earth years! Although the Sun looks like a perfect bright yellow sphere, there are sometimes a number of dark spots on it. These are sunspots, areas where the Sun's temperature is coolest, roughly between 2,700 °C to 4,200 °C (4,900 °F to 7,600 °F). Usually the Sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 °C (9,900 °F), and is much hotter inside! To imagine how hot that is, temperatures on Earth never really exceed 50 °C (122 °F), and the average temperature around the planet is about 15 °C (59 °F).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Sun is a star found at the center of the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It makes up around 99.86% of the Solar System’s mass.</li>
                    <li>At around 1,392,000 kilometres (865,000 miles) wide, the Sun’s diameter is about 110 times wider than Earth’s.</li>
                    <li>Around 74% of the Sun’s mass is made up of hydrogen. Helium makes up around 24% while heavier elements such as oxygen, carbon, iron and neon make up the remaining percentage.</li>
                    <li>Light from the Sun reaches Earth in around 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>The Sun’s surface temperature is around 5500 degrees Celsius (9941 degrees Fahrenheit), so pack plenty of sunscreen if you plan on visiting (remembering that the average distance from the Sun to the Earth is around 150 million kilometers).</li>
                    <li>The Sun’s core is around 13600000 degrees Celsius!</li>
                    <li>The Sun generates huge amounts of energy by combining hydrogen nuclei into helium. This process is called nuclear fusion.</li>
                    <li>Because of the Sun’s huge influence on Earth, many early cultures saw the Sun as a deity or god. For example, Ancient Egyptians had a sun god called Ra while in Aztec mythology there is a sun god named Tonatiuh.</li>
                    <li>The Sun produces a solar wind which contains charged particles such as electrons and protons. They escape the Sun’s intense gravity because of their high kinetic energy and the high temperature of the Sun’s corona (a type of plasma atmosphere that extends into space).</li>
                    <li>Planets with strong magnetic fields such as Earth manage to deflect most of these charged particles as they approach.</li>
                    <li>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth.</li>
                    <li>One million Earths could fit inside the Sun: If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</li>
                    <li>Eventually, the Sun will consume the Earth: When all the Hydrogen has been burned, the Sun will continue for about 130 million more years, burning Helium, during which time it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant.</li>
                    <li>The Sun will one day be about the size of Earth: After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse, retaining its enormous mass, but containing the approximate volume of our planet. When this happens, it will be called a white dwarf.</li>
                    <li>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System: The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</li>
                    <li>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere: There is only a 10 kilometre difference in its polar diameter compared to its equatorial diameter. Considering the vast expanse of the Sun, this means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in nature.</li>
                    <li>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth: With a mean average distance of 150 million kilometres from Earth and with light travelling at 300,000 kilometres per second, dividing one by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds, or eight minutes and 20 seconds. Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will already have taken millions of years to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</li>
                    <li>The Sun travels at 220 kilometres per second: The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.</li>
                    <li>The distance from the Sun to Earth changes throughout the year: Because the Earth travels on an elliptical orbit around the Sun, the distance between the two bodies varies from 147 to 152 million kilometres. The distance between the Earth and the Sun is called an Astronomical Unit (AU).</li>
                    <li>The Sun is middle-aged: At around 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately another 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf. </li>
                    <li>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field: Solar flares occur when magnetic energy is released by the Sun during magnetic storms, which we see as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines are twisted and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth.</li>
                    <li>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius: At the Sun’s core, energy is generated by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Because hot objects generally expand, the Sun would explode like a giant bomb if it weren’t for its enormous gravitational force.</li>
                    <li>The Sun generates solar wind: This is a stream of charged particles, which travels through the Solar System at approximately 450 kilometres per second. Solar wind occurs where the magnetic field of the Sun extends into space instead of following its surface.</li>
