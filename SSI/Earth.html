                <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and, of course, life. Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system — smaller than the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranusand Neptune, but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Marsand Venus. Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers), and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball, although it is not perfectly round, instead being more of an "oblate spheroid" whose spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator. Roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface is covered by water, most of it in the oceans. About a fifth of Earth's atmosphereis made up of oxygen, produced by plants. While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been learned in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space.</p>
                <p>Earth is a planet which orbits the Sun every 365 and a quarter days, taking 23 hours and 56 minutes to turn on its axis. This is the reason that a year is 365 days long and a day is 24 hours long. It has one Moon which orbits the planet every 27 days. It is a geologically active planet, meaning that its surface features and landscapes are constantly being reformed by volcanoes, earthquakes, changes in climate (temperature), and weather. Like other planets and moons, it is a target for asteroids and meteorites travelling through space. Most of these objects burn up in the planet's protective atmosphere, although some do survive and leave huge impact craters. For thousands of years, people believed that Earth was at the centre of the universe and that everything else - the Sun, the Moon, the planets and the stars - span around it. It was only about 500 to 600 years ago when astronomers were able to prove otherwise, and it finally became accepted that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System and that Earth orbited it.</p>
                <p>The planet, like Mars, has ice caps at both of its poles. These are huge areas of frozen water which, if they were melted, could flood the planet. These polar ice caps are caused by the planet's axis having a slight tilt, meaning that they spend large parts of the year receiving almost no sunlight or heat. This tilt also causes the seasons on the planet. Mars is similar to Earth in this way, being a planet with a similar tilt.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System to have water in its three states of matter: as a solid (ice), a liquid (sea, rain, etc.) and as a gas (clouds). These are all shown below. Water is, of course, the most important liquid for life. Water as solid, liquid and gas.</li>

                    <li>Earth is almost five billion years old, although life (resembling life as we know it) has only existed on the planet for the last 150 million to 200 million years. This means that life has only been present on Earth for only 5%-10% of its lifetime.</li>

                    <li>Earth and Mercury are the two most dense planets in the Solar System. This means that particles inside the planet are most closely packed together.</li>

                    <li>The length of time it takes for Earth to orbit the Sun is 365 and a quarter days. To make up this extra quarter which isn't counted at the end of a year, we have an extra day every four years on 29th February. The next Leap Year will be in 2012.</li>

                    <li>Earth is gradually slowing down. Every few years, an extra second is added to make up for lost time. Millions of years ago, a day on Earth will have been 20 hours long. It is believed that, in millions of years time, a day on Earth will be 27 hours long.</li>

                    <li>The centre of the Earth, its core, is molten. This means that it is liquid rock which sometimes erupts onto the surface through volcanic eruptions. This core is 7,500°c, hotter than the surface of the Sun!</li>

                    <li>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System not to be named after a mythical God.</li>

                    <li>Despite being called Earth, only 29% of the surface is actually 'earth.' The rest of the planet's surface (71%) is made up of water.</li>

                    <li>From a distance, Earth would be the brightest of the planets. This is because sunlight is reflected off the planet's water.</li>

                    <li>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System known to be geologically active, with Earthquakes and volcanoes forming the landscape, replenishing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and erasing impact craters from meteors.</li>
