                    <h3 class="spacewe-font">A galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system that consists of stars, stellar objects (such as brown dwarfs and neutron stars), nebulae, an interstellar medium of gas and dust, black holes, and an unknown component of dark matter. Examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars to giants with a hundred trillion stars or more, each orbiting through their galaxy. There are probably more than 170 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Astronomers sort galaxies into three main types by their shapes: spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars, and further divide them into subtypes based on their particular characteristics.

                <h2 class="section-heading">MILKY WAY</h2>
                <p>The Milky Way began as a series of dense regions in the early universe not long after the Big Bang. The first stars to form were in globular clusters that still exist. They are among the oldest stars formed in the Milky Way region.</p>
                <p>The Milky Way has grown by merging with other galaxies through time. It is currently acquiring stars from a very small galaxy called the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal, as well as gobbling up material from the Magellanic Clouds.</p>
                <p>The Milky Way moves through space at a velocity of about 552 kilometres per second (343 miles per second) with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.</p>
                <p>The Milky Way’s central core contains a supermassive black hole. It is commonly referred to as Sagittarius A*. It contains the mass of about 2.6 million Suns.</p>
                <p>The stars, gas and dust of the Milky Way all orbit the centre at a rate of about 220 kilometres per second. This constant rate for all stars at different distances from the core implies the existence of a shell of dark matter surrounding our galaxy.</p>
                <p>Our galaxy will collide with Andromeda Galaxy in about 5 billion years. Some astronomers refer to our two galaxy as a binary system of giant spirals.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">MAGELLANIC CLOUDS</h2>
                <p>The Large Magellanic Cloud lies about 163 thousand light-years from Earth. Its companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud is about 200,000 light-years away.</p>
                <p>For many years astronomers thought the Magellanic Clouds orbited the Milky Way. Recent measurements may prove that they could be moving too fast for that.</p>
                <p>The Magellanic Clouds are gas-rich, meaning they have a higher portion of their mass as gas. They also have less portion of their mass bound up in metallic elements.</p>
                <p>The Magellanic Clouds have both had their shapes distorted by gravitational interactions with the Milky Way. As these galaxies pass near the Milky Way, their gravitational pull also misshapes the outer bars of our galaxy.</p>
                <p>Recent studies of the Small Magellanic Cloud indicate that it might be a former single galaxy split into two remnants. Gravitational interactions with the LMC may have broken that galaxy apart.</p>
                <p>The Large Magellanic Cloud contains a highly active starbirth region called the Tarantula Nebula. It is part of a larger cloud of gas and dust, and its high rate of star formation may be caused by compression of interstellar gas and dust by the collision of the cloud with the interstellar medium. The 1987a supernova exploded not far from this region.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">WHIRLPOOL GALAXY</h2>
                <p>The Whirlpool Galaxy was first discovered in 1773 by Charles Messier, who was charting the skies looking for objects that might be confused with comets.</p>
                <p>In 1845, astronomer William Parsons observed the galaxy pair with his telescope at Birr Castle, Ireland, and found the spiral structure of the Whirlpool.</p>
                <p>The Whirlpool and its companion, M51b have already passed by or through each other once as they dance through a cosmic merger. The smaller galaxy has been severely disrupted by the encounter, and the Whirlpool’s spiral arms are distorted.</p>
                <p>The Whirlpool Galaxy is undergoing huge bursts of starbirth due to its ongoing encounter with its smaller companion galaxy.</p>
                <p>The whirlpool, like many other galaxies, has a supermassive black hole at its heart, surrounded by rings of dust. The core of the galaxy is quite quite active — making the Whirlpool what astronomers call a “Seyfert galaxy”.</p>
                <p>The Whirlpool’s companion, called M51b, is a dwarf galaxy. Because it is being torn apart by the ongoing interaction, it cannot be easily classified. Its current appearance makes it look like an irregular galaxy.</p>
                <p>A bridge of gas and dust ties the two galaxies together as they merge.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">ANTENNAE GALAXY</h2>
                <p>Spiral galaxies that combine as the Antennae are doing will most likely ultimately end up as elliptical galaxies.The merger will erase all traces of their spiral arms.</p>
                <p>It is likely that when the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxies combine, they will look similar to the Antennae during at least one point of their interaction.</p>
                <p>Of the millions of new stars created during the Antennae merger, only about ten percent of them will live longer than 10 million years. That’s because they will be massive blue supergiants, a type of star that quickly consumes its nuclear fuel and explodes as a supernova.</p>
                <p>The remaining massive young star clusters formed during starburst activity will become the new galaxy’s globular clusters.</p>
                <p>The Antennae galaxies are the closest colliding galaxies to the Milky Way.

                <h2 class="section-heading">PINWHEEL GALAXY</h2>
                <p>The Pinwheel Galaxy is about twice the diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy, and is formally defined as a weakly barred spiral galaxy.</p>
                <p>There are more than 3,000 starbirth regions in the spiral arms of the Pinwheel Galaxy, the most of any similar type galaxy thus far observed. These are called HII regions, for the copious amounts of hydrogen they contain.</p>
                <p>The Pinwheel Galaxy has a fairly small central bulge, with about 3 billion solar masses. Compared to the starbirth action in the spiral arms, the bulge is very quiet, with almost no stars being born there.</p>
                <p>While many galaxies have a central supermassive black hole, astronomers have not found one at the heart of the Pinwheel Galaxy.</p>
                <p>There are many x-ray sources in the Pinwheel Galaxy. They emanate from exploded stars and regions around stellar-mass black holes (where material is heated as it falls into the black hole).</p>
                <p>The Pinwheel belongs to a group of galaxies that are all interacting with each other gravitationally. As a result of this dance, their shapes are distorted.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">SOMBRERO GALAXY</h2>
                <p>The Sombrero Galaxy may not be part of a formal galaxy group, but could be a member of a string of galaxies that extends away from the Virgo Cluster.</p>
                <p>As many as 2,000 globular clusters swarm around the core of the Sombrero Galaxy, and the number could be related to the size of the central bulge.</p>
                <p>The Sombrero has a central supermassive black hole at its heart. Observations of star motions near the black hole suggest it could have the mass of a billion Suns, perhaps the most massive of any black hole found so far at the heart of a galaxy.</p>
                <p>The Sombrero Galaxy is a favorite target for well-equipped amateur astronomers. If you have a good dark-sky sight, it can be spotted through binoculars; those with large telescopes can spot the dust lane. The Sombrero is a spring and early summer observing object half-way between the constellations Virgo and Corvus.</p>
                <p>NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope have been used to study the Sombrero in visible and infrared light. The starbirth regions stand out in infrared wavelengths are are mostly located along the outer rim of the dust ring surrounding the galaxy’s core.</p>
                <p>The Sombrero Galaxy looks as it does partly because we are viewing it “edge on” from our point of view here on Earth.</p>
